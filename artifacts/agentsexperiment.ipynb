The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[302] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[303] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[304] In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[305] In December 2016, Google announced that\\\\u2014starting in 2017\\\\u2014it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices.

became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet.[18] The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google. Google\\'s stock was then converted to Alphabet\\'s stock. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (where Alphabet is incorporated), a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[19] The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[4] Alphabet retains Google Inc.\\'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.\\'s former ticker symbols \\\\\"GOOG\\\\\" and \\\\\"GOOGL\\\\\"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.[20] On December 3, 2019, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles, remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, assumed the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google.[21] The firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.[22] On January 20, 2023, Pichai wrote a letter to all employees announcing that the company would be laying off about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce. In the letter, Pichai wrote, \\\\\"Over the past two years we\\'ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.\\\\\"[23] In January 2024, Waymo, the autonomous driving division of Alphabet Inc., which operates extensively in San Francisco, filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission to expand service in Los Angeles. Such a license would allow the company to make full use of its fleet in the city instead of test drives by invitation.[24] ## Structure [edit] Alphabet Inc. is the parent of a diverse set of subsidiaries:[25][26][27]\",\\n        \"output_data\": {\\n            \"subsidiaries\": [\\n                \"Google Inc.\",\\n                \"Waymo\"\\n            ],\\n            \"associated_domains\": [\\n                \"google.com\",\\n                \"waymo.com\"\\n            ]\\n        },\\n        \"error\": false\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model_name\": \"Subsidiaries and Associated Domains Extractor\",\\n        \"input_data\": \"In 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees.

The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million\\\\nwith a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12\\\\neach.[75][76][77] In October 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust\\\\nlawsuit against Alphabet, alleging anti-competitive practices.[78] On 2 December 2020, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint that\\\\nclaimed Alphabet Inc conducted unlawful monitoring and questioning of several\\\\nworkers at Google. The employees in question were fired for unionization\\\\nattempts and protesting company policies. The board also alleges that Google\\\\nunlawfully placed employees on administrative leave in retribution. Alphabet\\\\nInc has denied any wrongdoing and said it acted legally.[79] On 7 June 2021, Alphabet Inc., announced it had settled an antitrust suit with\\\\nthe French Autorit\\\\u00e9 de la concurrence with a payment of $270 million. The\\\\nsettlement amounted to less than 0.7% of Alphabet Inc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s yearly earnings.[80] On 12 June 2021, it was announced that Japan would launch an antitrust probe\\\\ninto Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. to determine whether their dealings with\\\\nJapanese smartphone makers violate current antitrust measures or could\\\\nnecessitate new ones.[81] In May 2022, Russian authorities seized Google\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Russian bank account,[82]\\\\nforcing them to file for bankruptcy one month later due to the inability to\\\\npay vendors and staff. However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube,\\\\nGmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[83] violate current antitrust measures or could\\\\nnecessitate new ones.[81] In May 2022, Russian authorities seized Google\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Russian bank account,[82]\\\\nforcing them to file for bankruptcy one month later due to the inability to\\\\npay vendors and staff.

Separation of responsibilities between Google Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrator and Google Cloud administrator is established. * Delegate responsibility over critical functions by assigning the relevant IAM roles. ### Create folders for sub-organizations Create a folder under the organization resource for each sub-organization. To create folders, you must have the Folder Admin or Folder Creator role at the parent level. For example, to create folders at the organization level, you must have one of these roles at the organization level. As part of creating a folder, you must assign it a name. Folder names must meet the following requirements: * The name may contain letters, digits, spaces, hyphens and underscores. * The folder\\'s display name must start and end with a letter or digit. * The name must be between 3 and 30 characters. * The name must be distinct from all other folders that share its parent.

Moving projects from one organization resource to another can be accomplished following the guide here.   * Each organization resource requires a Google Workspace account.

and Google Workspace, you can choose the scope at which each setting should apply\\\\u2014for example, you can specify the geographic location for your data by user, by group, or by organizational unit. When you plan to apply a new configuration, you can initially choose a small scope (for example, by user) and verify whether the configuration meets your expectations. When you\\'ve verified the configuration, you can then apply the same setting to a larger set of groups or organizational units. Unlike most settings, integrating a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with an external identity provider (IdP) has a global impact: * Enabling single sign-on is a global setting that applies to all users other than super admins. * Depending on your external IdP, setting up user provisioning can also have global impact. An accidental misconfiguration in the external IdP might lead to users inadvertently being modified, suspended, or even deleted. To mitigate these risks, have separate staging and production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace accounts: * Use the staging account to verify any risky configuration changes before applying the same change to your production account. * Create a few test users in the staging accounts that you and other administrators can use to verify configuration changes. But don\\'t grant your users access to the staging account. If you have separate staging and production instances of your external IdP, take these steps: * Integrate your staging Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your staging IdP instance. * Integrate your production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your production IdP instance. For example, suppose you plan to set up federation with Active Directory and have a separate Active Directory forest for testing purposes. In this case, you integrate your staging Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with the staging forest and the production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your main forest. Apply the same mapping approach for DNS domains, users, and groups to both forest/account pairs, as shown in the following diagram: ![\\\\\"Active](\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/ad-mapping-dns-domains-users-groups.svg\\\\\") Your production and staging Active Directory forests and domains might use DNS domains that don\\'t let you apply the same domain mapping approach for staging and production. In this case, consider registering more User Principal Name (UPN) suffix domains in your staging forest.\",\\n        \"output_data\": {\\n            \"subsidiaries\": [],\\n            \"associated_domains\": []\\n        },\\n        \"error\": false\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model_name\": \"Subsidiaries and Associated Domains Extractor\",\\n        \"input_data\": \"The fact that super admins are also organization administrators might be a\\\\nsecurity concern if your existing Google Workspace administrators are a\\\\ndifferent set of users from the users who will be in charge of managing your\\\\nGoogle Cloud organization. In this case, you might decide to create a separate\\\\nCloud Identity account that is dedicated to Google Cloud in order to limit the\\\\naccess of Google Workspace super admins to Google Cloud resources. Separating\\\\nGoogle Workspace and Google Cloud can have several unintended consequences. For example, you might try creating separate users in the Cloud Identity\\\\naccount and then restricting access to the Google Cloud organization users to\\\\nthe Cloud Identity account. This would ensure that your Google Cloud\\\\ndeployment and Google Workspace are fully isolated. However, duplicating users\\\\nnegatively affects both user experience and administrative overhead.\\\\nAdditionally, you wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to receive any notification emails sent by\\\\nGoogle Cloud because the domain used by Cloud Identity must be different from\\\\nthe domain used for Google Workspace and is therefore unsuitable for routing\\\\nemail. If you instead reference users from the Google Workspace account in your\\\\nGoogle Cloud organization, you undermine the isolation between Google\\\\nWorkspace and Google Cloud: ![\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Referencing](\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/referencing-users-\\\\nfrom-g-suite-account.svg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/) Google Workspace super admins have the ability to use domain-wide delegation\\\\nto impersonate any user in the same Google Workspace account. A rogue super\\\\nadmin could use their elevated privileges to regain access to Google Cloud. A more effective approach than using separate accounts is to segregate\\\\nresponsibilities between Google Workspace and Google Cloud administrators to\\\\nreduce the number of super admins:   * Most administrative duties in Google Workspace don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t require super admin privileges. Use pre-built administrative roles or custom administrator roles in place of super admin privileges to grant Google Workspace administrators the permissions necessary to conduct their duties.   * Retain only a minimal number of super-admin users and discourage everyday usage.   * Take advantage of auditing to detect suspicious activity among administrative users. ### Secure your external IdP when using single sign-on Cloud Identity and Google Workspace let you set up single sign-on with your\\\\nexternal IdP such as Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, or Okta (to\\\\nname a few). If single sign-on is enabled, Cloud Identity and Google Workspace\\\\ntrust the external IdP to authenticate users on Google\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s behalf.

Apply the same mapping approach for DNS domains, users, and groups to both\\\\ntenant/account pairs: ![\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Azure](\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/aad-mapping-dns-domains-\\\\nusers-groups.svg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/) Your production and staging Azure Active Directory tenants might use DNS\\\\ndomains that don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t let you apply the same domain mapping approach for staging\\\\nand production. In this case, consider adding an extra domain to your staging\\\\ntenant. ### Use disjoint DNS domains among Cloud Identity and Google Workspace\\\\naccounts When you first add a domain such as example.com to your Cloud Identity or\\\\nGoogle Workspace account, you need to verify that you own the domain. After\\\\nyou have added and verified a domain, you can add subdomains such as\\\\nmarketing.example.com and finance.example.com without having to verify each\\\\nsubdomain individually. However, if you add subdomains without verifying each one, conflicts can\\\\nresult if you have another Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account that\\\\nalready uses this subdomain. To avoid these conflicts, prefer using disjoint\\\\ndomains for each account. For example, if you need two Cloud Identity or\\\\nGoogle Workspace accounts, try to avoid using two domains where one domain is\\\\na subdomain of the other. Instead, use two domains that are not subdomains of\\\\nanother. This practice applies to the primary domain and to secondary domains. ### Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t separate Google Workspace and Google Cloud If you already use Google Workspace, some users in your Google Workspace\\\\naccount might have been granted super admin privileges so that they can carry\\\\nout administrative tasks. Users with super admin privileges are implicitly granted permission to modify\\\\nthe Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy of the organization node. This\\\\npermission enables super admins to assign themselves the organization\\\\nadministrators role or any other role in the Google Cloud organization. Having\\\\nsuper admin access to a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account also\\\\nenables a user to delete the account, its associated Google Cloud\\\\norganization, and all its resources. You therefore have to assume that super\\\\nadmins have full access to all resources within an organization. any other role in the Google Cloud organization.

of organizations that you create and their purposes can profoundly impact your security posture, the autonomy of your teams and departments, and the consistency and efficiency of your administration. The following sections describe best practices for deciding how many organizations to use. ### Use as few organizations as possible, but as many as necessary The resource hierarchy of an organization lets you reduce the effort of managing IAM policies and organizational policies by taking advantage of inheritance. By configuring policies at the folder or organization level, you ensure that policies are applied consistently across a sub-hierarchy of resources, and you avoid repetitive configuration work. To minimize your administrative overhead, it\\'s best to use as few organizations as possible. In contrast, you can gain additional flexibility and administrative autonomy by using multiple organizations. The following sections describe when you might require such additional flexibility or autonomy. In any case, when you are deciding how many organizations to use, consider all requirements that suggest using multiple organizations. Then use the smallest number of organizations that satisfies your requirements. ### Use organizations to delineate administrative authority Within a resource hierarchy, you can grant permissions at the resource, project, or folder level. The ultimate level at which you can grant a user permissions is the organization. A user who has been assigned the Organization Administrator role at the organization level has full control over the organization, its resources, and its IAM policies. An Organization Administrator can take control of any resource within the organization and is free to delegate administrative access to any other user. However, the capabilities of an Organization Administrator are confined to the organization, making the organization the ultimate scope of administrative authority:   * An Organization Administrator cannot access any resources in other organizations unless explicitly granted permission.   * No user outside the organization can take control away from an Organization Administrator of that organization. The right number of organizations to use depends on the number of independent groups of administrative users in your company:   * If your company is organized by function, you might have a single department that\\'s in charge of overseeing all Google Cloud deployments.   * If your company is organized by division or owns a number of autonomously-run subsidiaries, then there might not be a single department that\\'s in charge.\",\\n        \"output_data\": {\\n            \"subsidiaries\": [],\\n            \"associated_domains\": []\\n        },\\n        \"error\": false\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model_name\": \"Subsidiaries and Associated Domains Extractor\",\\n        \"input_data\": \"The importance of DNS and the impact on the overall security of your Google deployment extends beyond the sign-up process: * Google Workspace relies on DNS MX records for routing emails. By modifying these MX records, an attacker might be able to route emails to a different server and gain access to sensitive information. * If an attacker is able to add records to the DNS zone, they might then be able to reset the password of a super admin user and gain access to the account. To prevent DNS from becoming a weak link in your security posture, ensure that your DNS server is configured securely: * Limit the number of users that have administrative access to the DNS server that manages the primary domain used for Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. * Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t grant any user administrative access to your DNS server to whom you wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t also give super admin privileges in Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. * If you plan to deploy a workload on Google Cloud that has security requirements that aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t met by your existing DNS infrastructure, consider registering for that workload a new DNS domain that uses separate DNS servers or a managed DNS service. ### Export audit logs to BigQuery Cloud Identity and Google Workspace maintain multiple audit logs to keep track of configuration changes and other activities that might be relevant to the security of your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account. The following table summarizes these audit logs. Log | Activities captured Admin | Actions performed in your Google Admin Console Login | Successful, unsuccessful, and suspicious sign-in attempts to your domain Token | Instances of authorizing or revoking access to third-party mobile or web applications Groups | Changes to groups and group memberships You can access these audit logs either through the Admin Console or through the Reports API. For most audit logs, data is retained for 6 months. If you are operating in a regulated industry, retaining audit data for 6 months might not be sufficient. To retain data for a longer period of time, configure audit logs to be exported to BigQuery. the Admin Console or through the Reports API. For most audit logs, data is retained for 6 months.

There is a downside of having policies that apply to many projects and resources. Any change to the policy itself or the resource hierarchy the policy applies to might have far-reaching and unintended consequences. To mitigate this risk, it\\'s best to test policy changes before you apply them in your main organization. We recommend that you create a separate staging organization. This organization helps you test resource hierarchy changes, IAM policies, organizational policies, or other configuration that have potential organization-wide impact such as access levels and policies. To ensure that the results of tests or experiments conducted in the staging organization also apply to the production organization, configure the staging organization to use the same folder structure as your main organization, but with only a small number of projects.

From a security perspective, to prevent untested releases from accidentally\\\\nimpacting production workloads, you want to cleanly separate your test\\\\nenvironments from your production environments. Similarly, the two types of\\\\nenvironments have different requirements for IAM policies. For example, in\\\\norder for you to grant developers and testers the flexibility they need, the\\\\nsecurity requirements for your testing environments might be substantially\\\\nlooser than those of your production environments. As the following diagram shows, from a configuration perspective you want to\\\\nkeep your test environments as similar to your production environments as\\\\npossible. Any divergence increases the risk that a deployment that worked\\\\nproperly in a test environment fails when deployed to a production\\\\nenvironment. ![\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Keeping](\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/stage-production-\\\\nsimilarity.svg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/) To strike a balance between keeping environments isolated and consistent, use\\\\nfolders within the same organization to manage testing and production\\\\nenvironments:   * Apply any IAM policies or organizational policies that are common across environments at the organizational level (or by using a common parent folder).\\\\n  * Use the individual folders to manage IAM policies and organization policies that differ between different types of environments. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use your staging organization for managing testing environments.\\\\nTesting environments are critical to the productivity of development and\\\\nDevOps teams.

Encourage them to experiment with new\\\\nfeatures and services. Use a separate organization as the sandbox environment to support these types\\\\nof experimental activities. By using a separate organization, you can keep\\\\nexperiments unencumbered by any policies, configuration, or automation that\\\\nyou use in your production organization. Avoid using your staging organization for experimenting. Your staging\\\\nenvironment should use IAM and organization policies that are similar to your\\\\nproduction organization. Therefore, the staging environment is likely to be\\\\nsubject to the same limitations as your production environment. At the same\\\\ntime, relaxing policies in order to allow experiments would undermine the\\\\npurpose of your staging organization. To prevent your experimental organization from becoming disorganized, from\\\\ngenerating excessive cost, or from becoming a security risk, issue guidelines\\\\nthat define how teams are allowed to use the organization, and who bears\\\\nresponsibility for maintaining the organization. Additionally, consider\\\\nsetting up automation to automatically delete resources, or even entire\\\\nprojects, after a certain number of days. As the following diagram shows, when you create an organization for\\\\nexperimenting, you first create a dedicated Cloud Identity account. You then\\\\nuse the existing users from your main Cloud Identity or Google Workspace\\\\naccount to grant users access to the experimental organization. ![\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Experiment](\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/experiment-\\\\norganization.svg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/) To manage the additional Cloud Identity account, you need at least one super\\\\nadmin user account in the Cloud Identity account.

This includes three\\\\nprincipal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense\\\\nfor Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[143] In addition to its own\\\\nalgorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from its\\\\nacquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to\\\\nthe search context and the user history.[144][145] In 2007, Google launched\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AdSense for Mobile\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising\\\\nmarket.[146] Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their\\\\nwebsite, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a\\\\npage.[147] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a\\\\ntwo-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their\\\\nadvertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click\\\\nscheme.[148] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to\\\\ndisplay these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads\\\\nare clicked.[149] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of\\\\nclick fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on\\\\nadvertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser\\\\nto pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that\\\\napproximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[150]\\\\nGoogle Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015)\\\\nallows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of\\\\ntheir websites, as well as optimize their website\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s visibility. ### Artificial intelligence Google had previously utilized virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google\\\\nBard, prior to the announcement of Gemini in March 2024.

The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[302] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[303] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[304] In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[305] In December 2016, Google announced that\\\\u2014starting in 2017\\\\u2014it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices.

became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet.[18] The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google. Google\\'s stock was then converted to Alphabet\\'s stock. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (where Alphabet is incorporated), a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[19] The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[4] Alphabet retains Google Inc.\\'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.\\'s former ticker symbols \\\\\"GOOG\\\\\" and \\\\\"GOOGL\\\\\"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.[20] On December 3, 2019, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles, remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, assumed the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google.[21] The firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.[22] On January 20, 2023, Pichai wrote a letter to all employees announcing that the company would be laying off about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce. In the letter, Pichai wrote, \\\\\"Over the past two years we\\'ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.\\\\\"[23] In January 2024, Waymo, the autonomous driving division of Alphabet Inc., which operates extensively in San Francisco, filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission to expand service in Los Angeles. Such a license would allow the company to make full use of its fleet in the city instead of test drives by invitation.[24] ## Structure [edit] Alphabet Inc. is the parent of a diverse set of subsidiaries:[25][26][27]\",\\n        \"output_data\": {\\n            \"subsidiaries\": [\\n                \"Google Inc.\",\\n                \"Waymo\"\\n            ],\\n            \"associated_domains\": [\\n                \"google.com\",\\n                \"waymo.com\"\\n            ]\\n        },\\n        \"error\": false\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model_name\": \"Subsidiaries and Associated Domains Extractor\",\\n        \"input_data\": \"In 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees.

To create folders, you must have the Folder Admin or Folder Creator role at the parent level. For example, to create folders at the organization level, you must have one of these roles at the organization level. As part of creating a folder, you must assign it a name. Folder names must meet the following requirements: * The name may contain letters, digits, spaces, hyphens and underscores. * The folder\\'s display name must start and end with a letter or digit. * The name must be between 3 and 30 characters. * The name must be distinct from all other folders that share its parent.

and Google Workspace, you can choose the scope at which each setting should apply\\\\u2014for example, you can specify the geographic location for your data by user, by group, or by organizational unit. When you plan to apply a new configuration, you can initially choose a small scope (for example, by user) and verify whether the configuration meets your expectations. When you\\'ve verified the configuration, you can then apply the same setting to a larger set of groups or organizational units. Unlike most settings, integrating a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with an external identity provider (IdP) has a global impact: * Enabling single sign-on is a global setting that applies to all users other than super admins. * Depending on your external IdP, setting up user provisioning can also have global impact. An accidental misconfiguration in the external IdP might lead to users inadvertently being modified, suspended, or even deleted. To mitigate these risks, have separate staging and production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace accounts: * Use the staging account to verify any risky configuration changes before applying the same change to your production account. * Create a few test users in the staging accounts that you and other administrators can use to verify configuration changes. But don\\'t grant your users access to the staging account. If you have separate staging and production instances of your external IdP, take these steps: * Integrate your staging Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your staging IdP instance. * Integrate your production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your production IdP instance. For example, suppose you plan to set up federation with Active Directory and have a separate Active Directory forest for testing purposes. In this case, you integrate your staging Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with the staging forest and the production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your main forest. Apply the same mapping approach for DNS domains, users, and groups to both forest/account pairs, as shown in the following diagram: ![\\\\\"Active](\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/ad-mapping-dns-domains-users-groups.svg\\\\\") Your production and staging Active Directory forests and domains might use DNS domains that don\\'t let you apply the same domain mapping approach for staging and production.

In this case, you might decide to create a separate\\\\nCloud Identity account that is dedicated to Google Cloud in order to limit the\\\\naccess of Google Workspace super admins to Google Cloud resources. Separating\\\\nGoogle Workspace and Google Cloud can have several unintended consequences. For example, you might try creating separate users in the Cloud Identity\\\\naccount and then restricting access to the Google Cloud organization users to\\\\nthe Cloud Identity account. This would ensure that your Google Cloud\\\\ndeployment and Google Workspace are fully isolated. However, duplicating users\\\\nnegatively affects both user experience and administrative overhead.\\\\nAdditionally, you wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to receive any notification emails sent by\\\\nGoogle Cloud because the domain used by Cloud Identity must be different from\\\\nthe domain used for Google Workspace and is therefore unsuitable for routing\\\\nemail. If you instead reference users from the Google Workspace account in your\\\\nGoogle Cloud organization, you undermine the isolation between Google\\\\nWorkspace and Google Cloud: ![\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Referencing](\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/referencing-users-\\\\nfrom-g-suite-account.svg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/) Google Workspace super admins have the ability to use domain-wide delegation\\\\nto impersonate any user in the same Google Workspace account. A rogue super\\\\nadmin could use their elevated privileges to regain access to Google Cloud. A more effective approach than using separate accounts is to segregate\\\\nresponsibilities between Google Workspace and Google Cloud administrators to\\\\nreduce the number of super admins:   * Most administrative duties in Google Workspace don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t require super admin privileges. Use pre-built administrative roles or custom administrator roles in place of super admin privileges to grant Google Workspace administrators the permissions necessary to conduct their duties.   * Retain only a minimal number of super-admin users and discourage everyday usage.   * Take advantage of auditing to detect suspicious activity among administrative users. ### Secure your external IdP when using single sign-on Cloud Identity and Google Workspace let you set up single sign-on with your\\\\nexternal IdP such as Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, or Okta (to\\\\nname a few).

In this case, consider adding an extra domain to your staging\\\\ntenant. ### Use disjoint DNS domains among Cloud Identity and Google Workspace\\\\naccounts When you first add a domain such as example.com to your Cloud Identity or\\\\nGoogle Workspace account, you need to verify that you own the domain. After\\\\nyou have added and verified a domain, you can add subdomains such as\\\\nmarketing.example.com and finance.example.com without having to verify each\\\\nsubdomain individually. However, if you add subdomains without verifying each one, conflicts can\\\\nresult if you have another Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account that\\\\nalready uses this subdomain. To avoid these conflicts, prefer using disjoint\\\\ndomains for each account. For example, if you need two Cloud Identity or\\\\nGoogle Workspace accounts, try to avoid using two domains where one domain is\\\\na subdomain of the other. Instead, use two domains that are not subdomains of\\\\nanother. This practice applies to the primary domain and to secondary domains. ### Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t separate Google Workspace and Google Cloud If you already use Google Workspace, some users in your Google Workspace\\\\naccount might have been granted super admin privileges so that they can carry\\\\nout administrative tasks. Users with super admin privileges are implicitly granted permission to modify\\\\nthe Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy of the organization node.

of organizations that you create and their purposes can profoundly impact your security posture, the autonomy of your teams and departments, and the consistency and efficiency of your administration. The following sections describe best practices for deciding how many organizations to use. ### Use as few organizations as possible, but as many as necessary The resource hierarchy of an organization lets you reduce the effort of managing IAM policies and organizational policies by taking advantage of inheritance. By configuring policies at the folder or organization level, you ensure that policies are applied consistently across a sub-hierarchy of resources, and you avoid repetitive configuration work. To minimize your administrative overhead, it\\'s best to use as few organizations as possible. In contrast, you can gain additional flexibility and administrative autonomy by using multiple organizations. The following sections describe when you might require such additional flexibility or autonomy. In any case, when you are deciding how many organizations to use, consider all requirements that suggest using multiple organizations. Then use the smallest number of organizations that satisfies your requirements. ### Use organizations to delineate administrative authority Within a resource hierarchy, you can grant permissions at the resource, project, or folder level. The ultimate level at which you can grant a user permissions is the organization. A user who has been assigned the Organization Administrator role at the organization level has full control over the organization, its resources, and its IAM policies. An Organization Administrator can take control of any resource within the organization and is free to delegate administrative access to any other user. However, the capabilities of an Organization Administrator are confined to the organization, making the organization the ultimate scope of administrative authority:   * An Organization Administrator cannot access any resources in other organizations unless explicitly granted permission.   * No user outside the organization can take control away from an Organization Administrator of that organization. The right number of organizations to use depends on the number of independent groups of administrative users in your company:   * If your company is organized by function, you might have a single department that\\'s in charge of overseeing all Google Cloud deployments.   * If your company is organized by division or owns a number of autonomously-run subsidiaries, then there might not be a single department that\\'s in charge.\",\\n        \"output_data\": {\\n            \"subsidiaries\": [],\\n            \"associated_domains\": []\\n        },\\n        \"error\": false\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model_name\": \"Subsidiaries and Associated Domains Extractor\",\\n        \"input_data\": \"The importance of DNS and the impact on the overall security of your Google deployment extends beyond the sign-up process: * Google Workspace relies on DNS MX records for routing emails. By modifying these MX records, an attacker might be able to route emails to a different server and gain access to sensitive information. * If an attacker is able to add records to the DNS zone, they might then be able to reset the password of a super admin user and gain access to the account. To prevent DNS from becoming a weak link in your security posture, ensure that your DNS server is configured securely: * Limit the number of users that have administrative access to the DNS server that manages the primary domain used for Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. * Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t grant any user administrative access to your DNS server to whom you wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t also give super admin privileges in Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. * If you plan to deploy a workload on Google Cloud that has security requirements that aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t met by your existing DNS infrastructure, consider registering for that workload a new DNS domain that uses separate DNS servers or a managed DNS service. ### Export audit logs to BigQuery Cloud Identity and Google Workspace maintain multiple audit logs to keep track of configuration changes and other activities that might be relevant to the security of your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account. The following table summarizes these audit logs. Log | Activities captured Admin | Actions performed in your Google Admin Console Login | Successful, unsuccessful, and suspicious sign-in attempts to your domain Token | Instances of authorizing or revoking access to third-party mobile or web applications Groups | Changes to groups and group memberships You can access these audit logs either through the Admin Console or through the Reports API.

To mitigate this risk, it\\'s best to test policy changes before you apply them in your main organization. We recommend that you create a separate staging organization. This organization helps you test resource hierarchy changes, IAM policies, organizational policies, or other configuration that have potential organization-wide impact such as access levels and policies. To ensure that the results of tests or experiments conducted in the staging organization also apply to the production organization, configure the staging organization to use the same folder structure as your main organization, but with only a small number of projects.

From a security perspective, to prevent untested releases from accidentally\\\\nimpacting production workloads, you want to cleanly separate your test\\\\nenvironments from your production environments. Similarly, the two types of\\\\nenvironments have different requirements for IAM policies. For example, in\\\\norder for you to grant developers and testers the flexibility they need, the\\\\nsecurity requirements for your testing environments might be substantially\\\\nlooser than those of your production environments. As the following diagram shows, from a configuration perspective you want to\\\\nkeep your test environments as similar to your production environments as\\\\npossible. Any divergence increases the risk that a deployment that worked\\\\nproperly in a test environment fails when deployed to a production\\\\nenvironment. ![\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Keeping](\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/stage-production-\\\\nsimilarity.svg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/) To strike a balance between keeping environments isolated and consistent, use\\\\nfolders within the same organization to manage testing and production\\\\nenvironments:   * Apply any IAM policies or organizational policies that are common across environments at the organizational level (or by using a common parent folder).\\\\n  * Use the individual folders to manage IAM policies and organization policies that differ between different types of environments. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use your staging organization for managing testing environments.\\\\nTesting environments are critical to the productivity of development and\\\\nDevOps teams.

By using a separate organization, you can keep\\\\nexperiments unencumbered by any policies, configuration, or automation that\\\\nyou use in your production organization. Avoid using your staging organization for experimenting. Your staging\\\\nenvironment should use IAM and organization policies that are similar to your\\\\nproduction organization. Therefore, the staging environment is likely to be\\\\nsubject to the same limitations as your production environment. At the same\\\\ntime, relaxing policies in order to allow experiments would undermine the\\\\npurpose of your staging organization. To prevent your experimental organization from becoming disorganized, from\\\\ngenerating excessive cost, or from becoming a security risk, issue guidelines\\\\nthat define how teams are allowed to use the organization, and who bears\\\\nresponsibility for maintaining the organization. Additionally, consider\\\\nsetting up automation to automatically delete resources, or even entire\\\\nprojects, after a certain number of days. As the following diagram shows, when you create an organization for\\\\nexperimenting, you first create a dedicated Cloud Identity account.
