Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[62] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\".[63][64] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[65] Additionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google.[49] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.[66] ### Initial public offering On August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering, listing the company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GOOG. At that time Page, Brin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[67] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[70][71] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[72] ![](\\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Eric_Schmidt_at_the_37th_G8_Summit_in_Deauville_037.jpg/170px- Eric_Schmidt_at_the_37th_G8_Summit_in_Deauville_037.jpg\\\")Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[70][71] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[72] ![](\\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Eric_Schmidt_at_the_37th_G8_Summit_in_Deauville_037.jpg/170px- Eric_Schmidt_at_the_37th_G8_Summit_in_Deauville_037.jpg\\\")Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011",

The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been\nfired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[108] On November 1,\n2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-\nout to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment\ncomplaints.[109][110] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the\nprotests.[111] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating\nagainst internal activists.[107] On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market,\nlaunching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.[112] On June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it\nwould investigate Google for antitrust violations.[113] This led to the filing\nof an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused\na monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[114] In December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became\nGoogle's new commerce chief.

At IPO,\nthe company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] The\nsale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23\nbillion.[72] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350\nfor the first time on October 31, 2007,[199] primarily because of strong sales\nand earnings in the online advertising market.[200] The surge in stock price\nwas fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional\ninvestors and mutual funds.[200] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares\nand GOOGL class A shares.[201] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock\nexchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock\nExchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to\nAlphabet Inc., Google\\\\'s holding company, since the fourth quarter of\n2015.[update][202] In the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit,\nlargely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from\nnewspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[203][204][205] For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total\nadvertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other\nrevenues.[206] In 2011, 96% of Google\\\\'s revenue was derived from its\nadvertising programs.[207] Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012,\ngenerating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page\ncommented, \\\\\"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36%\nyear-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter.

When you plan to apply a new configuration, you can initially choose a small scope (for example, by user) and verify whether the configuration meets your expectations. When you've verified the configuration, you can then apply the same setting to a larger set of groups or organizational units. Unlike most settings, integrating a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with an external identity provider (IdP) has a global impact: * Enabling single sign-on is a global setting that applies to all users other than super admins. * Depending on your external IdP, setting up user provisioning can also have global impact. An accidental misconfiguration in the external IdP might lead to users inadvertently being modified, suspended, or even deleted. To mitigate these risks, have separate staging and production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace accounts: * Use the staging account to verify any risky configuration changes before applying the same change to your production account. * Create a few test users in the staging accounts that you and other administrators can use to verify configuration changes. But don't grant your users access to the staging account. If you have separate staging and production instances of your external IdP, take these steps: * Integrate your staging Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your staging IdP instance. * Integrate your production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your production IdP instance. For example, suppose you plan to set up federation with Active Directory and have a separate Active Directory forest for testing purposes. In this case, you integrate your staging Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with the staging forest and the production Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account with your main forest. Apply the same mapping approach for DNS domains, users, and groups to both forest/account pairs, as shown in the following diagram: ![Active](\"/static/architecture/identity/images/ad-mapping-dns-domains-users-groups.svg\") Your production and staging Active Directory forests and domains might use DNS domains that don't let you apply the same domain mapping approach for staging and production. In this case, consider registering more User Principal Name (UPN) suffix domains in your staging forest.",

In this case, you might decide to create a separate\nCloud Identity account that is dedicated to Google Cloud in order to limit the\naccess of Google Workspace super admins to Google Cloud resources. Separating\nGoogle Workspace and Google Cloud can have several unintended consequences. For example, you might try creating separate users in the Cloud Identity\naccount and then restricting access to the Google Cloud organization users to\nthe Cloud Identity account. This would ensure that your Google Cloud\ndeployment and Google Workspace are fully isolated. However, duplicating users\nnegatively affects both user experience and administrative overhead.\nAdditionally, you wouldn\\\\'t be able to receive any notification emails sent by\nGoogle Cloud because the domain used by Cloud Identity must be different from\nthe domain used for Google Workspace and is therefore unsuitable for routing\nemail. If you instead reference users from the Google Workspace account in your\nGoogle Cloud organization, you undermine the isolation between Google\nWorkspace and Google Cloud: ![\\\\\\\"Referencing](\\\\\\\"/static/architecture/identity/images/referencing-users-\nfrom-g-suite-account.svg\\\\\\\"/) Google Workspace super admins have the ability to use domain-wide delegation\nto impersonate any user in the same Google Workspace account. A rogue super\nadmin could use their elevated privileges to regain access to Google Cloud. A more effective approach than using separate accounts is to segregate\nresponsibilities between Google Workspace and Google Cloud administrators to\nreduce the number of super admins:   * Most administrative duties in Google Workspace don\\\\'t require super admin privileges. Use pre-built administrative roles or custom administrator roles in place of super admin privileges to grant Google Workspace administrators the permissions necessary to conduct their duties.   * Retain only a minimal number of super-admin users and discourage everyday usage.   * Take advantage of auditing to detect suspicious activity among administrative users. ### Secure your external IdP when using single sign-on Cloud Identity and Google Workspace let you set up single sign-on with your\nexternal IdP such as Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, or Okta (to\nname a few).

In this case, consider adding an extra domain to your staging\ntenant. ### Use disjoint DNS domains among Cloud Identity and Google Workspace\naccounts When you first add a domain such as example.com to your Cloud Identity or\nGoogle Workspace account, you need to verify that you own the domain. After\nyou have added and verified a domain, you can add subdomains such as\nmarketing.example.com and finance.example.com without having to verify each\nsubdomain individually. However, if you add subdomains without verifying each one, conflicts can\nresult if you have another Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account that\nalready uses this subdomain. To avoid these conflicts, prefer using disjoint\ndomains for each account. For example, if you need two Cloud Identity or\nGoogle Workspace accounts, try to avoid using two domains where one domain is\na subdomain of the other. Instead, use two domains that are not subdomains of\nanother. This practice applies to the primary domain and to secondary domains. ### Don\\\\'t separate Google Workspace and Google Cloud If you already use Google Workspace, some users in your Google Workspace\naccount might have been granted super admin privileges so that they can carry\nout administrative tasks. Users with super admin privileges are implicitly granted permission to modify\nthe Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy of the organization node.

The following sections describe best practices for deciding how many organizations to use. ### Use as few organizations as possible, but as many as necessary The resource hierarchy of an organization lets you reduce the effort of managing IAM policies and organizational policies by taking advantage of inheritance. By configuring policies at the folder or organization level, you ensure that policies are applied consistently across a sub-hierarchy of resources, and you avoid repetitive configuration work. To minimize your administrative overhead, it's best to use as few organizations as possible. In contrast, you can gain additional flexibility and administrative autonomy by using multiple organizations. The following sections describe when you might require such additional flexibility or autonomy. In any case, when you are deciding how many organizations to use, consider all requirements that suggest using multiple organizations. Then use the smallest number of organizations that satisfies your requirements. ### Use organizations to delineate administrative authority Within a resource hierarchy, you can grant permissions at the resource, project, or folder level. The ultimate level at which you can grant a user permissions is the organization. A user who has been assigned the Organization Administrator role at the organization level has full control over the organization, its resources, and its IAM policies. An Organization Administrator can take control of any resource within the organization and is free to delegate administrative access to any other user. However, the capabilities of an Organization Administrator are confined to the organization, making the organization the ultimate scope of administrative authority:   * An Organization Administrator cannot access any resources in other organizations unless explicitly granted permission.   * No user outside the organization can take control away from an Organization Administrator of that organization. The right number of organizations to use depends on the number of independent groups of administrative users in your company:   * If your company is organized by function, you might have a single department that's in charge of overseeing all Google Cloud deployments.   * If your company is organized by division or owns a number of autonomously-run subsidiaries, then there might not be a single department that's in charge. * If your company is organized by function, you might have a single department that's in charge of overseeing all Google Cloud deployments.   * If your company is organized by division or owns a number of autonomously-run subsidiaries, then there might not be a single department that's in charge.",

This organization helps you test resource hierarchy changes, IAM policies, organizational policies, or other configuration that have potential organization-wide impact such as access levels and policies. To ensure that the results of tests or experiments conducted in the staging organization also apply to the production organization, configure the staging organization to use the same folder structure as your main organization, but with only a small number of projects.

From a security perspective, to prevent untested releases from accidentally impacting production workloads, you want to cleanly separate your test environments from your production environments. Similarly, the two types of environments have different requirements for IAM policies. For example, in order for you to grant developers and testers the flexibility they need, the security requirements for your testing environments might be substantially looser than those of your production environments.

At the same\ntime, relaxing policies in order to allow experiments would undermine the\npurpose of your staging organization.

The\ndomain name is derived from the primary domain name of the associated Cloud\nIdentity or Google Workspace account. If there is a canonical DNS domain name that is used throughout your company,\nuse that domain as primary domain in your production Cloud Identity or Google\nWorkspace account.

When billing accounts are associated with an organization, they are considered\na sub-resource of the organization and are subject to IAM policies defined\nwithin the organization. Most importantly, this means that you can use the\nBilling IAM roles to define which users or groups are allowed to administer or\nuse an account. A user who has been granted the Billing Account User role can link a project\nto a billing account, causing the resources to be billed to this account.\nLinking a project to a billing account works within the same organization, but\nalso across organizations. If you use multiple organizations, you can take advantage of the fact that\nbilling accounts can be used across organizations. This lets you decide how\nmany billing accounts you need independent of how many organizations you need. The right number of billing accounts depends exclusively on your commercial or\ncontractual requirements such as currency, payment profile, and the number of\nseparate invoices you need. As you did with accounts and organizations, in\norder to minimize complexity, you want to use the smallest number of billing\naccounts that satisfies your requirements. To break down costs accrued across multiple organizations, configure your\nbilling account to export billing data to BigQuery. Each record exported to\nBigQuery not only contains the project name and ID, but also the ID of the\norganization the project is associated with (in the project.ancestry_numbers\nfield). ## What\\\\'s next   * Create a new Cloud Identity account\n  * Learn how Google Cloud lets you authenticate corporate users in a hybrid environment and common patterns.\n  * Review the best practices for federating Google Cloud with an external identity provider.\n  * Find out how to federate Google Cloud with Active Directory or Azure Active Directory.\n  * Review the best practices for managing identity and access.
